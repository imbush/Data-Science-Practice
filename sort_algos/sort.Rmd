# Sorting Algorithms in R
This notebook contains notes and examples of sorting algorithms by Inle Bush. It describes and gives R code for Selection Sort.

## Selection Sort
* in-place comparison sorting algorithm

* **Description**:
    * Creates a sorted (initially empty) and unsorted (input list) list. 
    * Iteratively adds the minimum from the unsorted list to the sorted list.

* **Worst case**: 
    * O($n^2$) comparisons
    * O($n$) swaps

```{r Selection Sort}
sample(1:10)

selection_sort <- function(v) {
  for (i in 1:(length(v) - 1)) { # i is first index of unsorted list
    
    jmin <- i # Initially sets minimum to element at i 
    
    for (j in (i + 1):length(v)) { # Loops through items after i
      if (v[[j]] < v[[jmin]]) jmin <- j # If item is smaller than current min, set min to item
    }
    
    if (jmin != i) { # Does not swap i and jmin if jmin is i
      v[c(i, jmin)] <- v[c(jmin, i)] # Switches jmin and i items
    }
    print(v)
  }
}

#Testing
print('Example:')
print(vect <- sample(1:10))
selection_sort(vect)
```
